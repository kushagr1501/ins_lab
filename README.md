# Classical Encryption Techniques Repository

## Description
This repository contains implementations of various classical encryption techniques, including substitution and transposition ciphers. These programs demonstrate fundamental cryptographic methods used in historical encryption systems.

## List of Implemented Ciphers
- **Playfair Cipher**
- **RSA Encryption**
- **Vigen√®re Cipher**
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**
- **Feistel Network Cipher**
- **Hill Cipher**
- **Hybrid Cipher** (Combination of different encryption techniques)
- **Monoalphabetic Cipher**

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` for Linux/macOS, or MinGW for Windows)
- Basic understanding of cryptographic principles

## How to Run the Programs
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kushagr1501/ins_lab.git
   cd ins_lab
   ```
2. Navigate to the respective cipher directory.
3. Compile the program using:
   ```sh
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./output  # On Linux/macOS
   output.exe  # On Windows
   ```
